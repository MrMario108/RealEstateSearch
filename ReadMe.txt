Real Estate Search
It's a project for programming practice. 

The project helps looking for real estate property at a reasonable price at polish websites.

In first version the module scrapingOLX scraps sites by using users settings and sends results to the database through API.
This module is running by schedule. I am going to rebuild the module to run from django level and without RESTapi. It was made for an experiment.

The first web portal is olx.pl. In the future, it will be more.
